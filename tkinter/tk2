    widget.pack(options) 
    

    expand: If the expand is set to true, the widget expands to fill any space.
    
    Fill: By default, the fill is set to NONE. However, we can set it to X or Y to determine whether the widget contains any extra space.
    
    size: it represents the side of the parent to which the widget is to be placed on the window.



from tkinter import *  

parent = Tk()  

redbutton = Button(parent, text = "Red", fg = "red")  

redbutton.pack( side = LEFT)  

greenbutton = Button(parent, text = "Black", fg = "black") 

greenbutton.pack( side = RIGHT )  

bluebutton = Button(parent, text = "Blue", fg = "blue") 

bluebutton.pack( side = TOP )  

blackbutton = Button(parent, text = "Green", fg = "red")  

blackbutton.pack( side = BOTTOM)  

parent.mainloop()
