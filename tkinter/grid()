Python Tkinter grid() method

The grid() geometry manager organizes the widgets in the tabular form. 
We can specify the rows and columns as the options in the method call. 
We can also specify the column span (width) or rowspan(height) of a widget. 

from tkinter import * 

parent = Tk()  

name = Label(parent,text = "Name").grid(row = 0, column = 0)  

e1 = Entry(parent).grid(row = 0, column = 1)  

password = Label(parent,text = "Password").grid(row = 1, column = 0)  

e2 = Entry(parent).grid(row = 1, column = 1)  

submit = Button(parent, text = "Submit").grid(row = 4, column = 0) 

parent.mainloop()
